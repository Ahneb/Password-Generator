# Password Generator
## About
This is my take on creating a randomly generated password based on user prompted criterias. 

Prompt boxes are used to ask for user inputs. Answers are taken based on whether the strings contain the letters Y or N allowing for mistyped words to still be processed even if one were to misspell the word yes or no. Inputs that do not give match the criteria expected cause an alert that tells you to try again and allows you to reinput value. 

After prompts are answered, the password is automatically generated and populated in the box. 2 console log features that I kept on show the following: 
    
    1) the most recent value added to the password string and 
    2) the password string as its being built.
